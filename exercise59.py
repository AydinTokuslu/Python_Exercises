# Write a function called password_validator. The function
# asks the user to enter a password. A valid password should have
# at least one upper letter, one lower letter, and one
# number. It should not be less than 8 characters long. When
# the user enters a password, the function should check if the
# password is valid. If the password is valid, the function should
# return the valid password. If the password is not valid, the
# function should tell the users the errors in the password and
# prompt the user to enter another password. The code should
# only stop once the user enters a valid password. (use while loop).
