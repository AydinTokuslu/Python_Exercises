# Write a function called make_tuples that takes two lists,
# equal lists, and combines them into a list of tuples. For
# example, if list a is [1,2,3,4] and list b is [5,6,7,8], your
# function should return [(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)].

    c = []
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        c.append((list1[i], list2[i]))
    print(c)


a=[1,2,3,4]
b=[5,6,7,8]
